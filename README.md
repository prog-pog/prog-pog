# Commit Changes With `git commit`
1. Use `git pull` to get all files to make shure you are up to date.
2. Use `git add <filename>` where \<filename\> is the name of the file.(duh)
3. Repeat step 2 as many tames as needed.
4. Use `git commit` a file will come up and ask for a commit message
5. You have to put a commit message then close the file.
5. You should be done!
